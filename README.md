# VUE Component Communication

In this project I learned about Provide / Inject way to communicate components on Vue

## Learned thing

- There are 2 ways of communication between components:
    - With props: A component can pass props to a child component
    - Provide / Inject: A child component can inject props that will be provided for an ancestor component
